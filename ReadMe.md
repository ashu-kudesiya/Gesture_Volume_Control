# Gesture Volume Control Project

## Introduction
***Gesture Volume Control*** is a modern technology that allows users to adjust the volume of their devices without the need for physical buttons or touchscreens.
The objective of this project is to develop an interface which will capture human ***hand gesture*** dynamically and will control the volume level. 
The human body’s motions are read by computer ***camera***. The computer then makes use of this data as input to handle applications.

## Features
- Recognizes specific hand gestures for volume adjustment.
- Provides real-time feedback on the volume level.
- Works with a variety of audio output devices.

## Tools & Technology
1. Framework:
   - Mediapipe
2. Libraries:
   - CV2
   - Mediapipe
   - Pycaw (AudioUtilities, IAudioEndpointVolume)
   - Time
   - Numpy
   - Math
3. Tool:
   – Visual Studio Code
